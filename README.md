# Linear and Quadratic Equation Solution Finder
A project I created to solve Linear and Quadratic equations. This was made with students who are doing GCSE's in mind (though, it can be used by anyone)
## Motivation
Algebra is one of the topics in mathematics that students seem to have trouble with. Solving quadratics and not knowing whether the answer is correct or not 
is a point of regular contention amongst students. This application is to check whether the solutions they got were correct by entering in the coefficients of
the polynomial.
