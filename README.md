# Linear and Quadratic Equation Solution Finder
A project I created to solve Linear and Quadratic equations. This was made with students who are doing GCSE's in mind (though, it can be used by anyone).
## Motivation
Working as a secondary school teacher and being a maths and physics tutor for a long time, I've helped students of all levels (primary to A-levels). The regular point of contention is algebra - factorising quadratics and solvin them. This application is to check whether the solutions they got were correct by entering in the coefficients of the polynomial.
