# Linear and Quadratic Equation Solution Finder
A project I created to solve Linear and Quadratic equations. This was made with students who are doing GCSE's in mind (though, it can be used by anyone).
## Motivation
Teaching maths and physics at a secondary school level and being a maths and physics tutor for a long time, I've helped students of all levels (KS1 to A-levels). And the regular point of contention amongst them is algebra - factorising quadratics and solving them. This application is to check whether the solutions they get are correct by entering in the coefficients of the polynomial.
